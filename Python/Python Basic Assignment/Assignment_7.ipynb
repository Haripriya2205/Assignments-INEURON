    "#### 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",

    "#### 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "**Ans:** Raw strings often appear in Regex objects because they treat backslashes () as literal characters rather than escape characters. Since regular expressions often contain many backslashes, using raw strings (prefixed with the 'r' character) makes it easier to write and read regular expressions without having to double escape backslashes."

Using group(1), group(2), etc., you can retrieve specific captured groups within parentheses in the regular expression."
